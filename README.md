## Installation

Here's an example spec for [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), but you're free to use whichever plugin manager suits you.

```lua
{
  "NeogitOrg/neogit",
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",         -- required
    "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", -- optional
    "sindrets/diffview.nvim",        -- optional
    "ibhagwan/fzf-lua",              -- optional
  },
  config = true
}
```

If you're not using lazy, you'll need to require and setup the plugin like so:

```lua
-- init.lua
local neogit = require('neogit')
neogit.setup {}
```

## Compatibility

The `master` branch will always be compatible with the latest **stable** release of Neovim, and with the latest **nightly** build as well.

Some features may only be available using unreleased (neovim nightly) API's - to use them, set your plugin manager to track the `nightly` branch instead. 

The `nightly` branch has the same stability guarantees as the `master` branch.

## Configuration

You can configure neogit by running the `neogit.setup()` function, passing a table as the argument.

local neogit = require("neogit")

## Usage

You can either open Neogit by using the `Neogit` command:

```vim
:Neogit             " Open the status buffer in a new tab
:Neogit cwd=<cwd>   " Use a different repository path
:Neogit cwd=%:p:h   " Uses the repository of the current file
:Neogit kind=<kind> " Open specified popup directly
:Neogit commit      " Open commit popup
```

Or using the lua api:

```lua
local neogit = require('neogit')

-- open using defaults
neogit.open()

-- open commit popup
neogit.open({ "commit" })

-- open with split kind
neogit.open({ kind = "split" })

-- open home directory
neogit.open({ cwd = "~" })
```

The `kind` option can be one of the following values:
- `tab`      (default)
- `replace`
- `floating` (EXPERIMENTAL! This currently doesn't work with popups. Very unstable)
- `split`
- `split_above`
- `vsplit`
- `auto` (`vsplit` if window would have 80 cols, otherwise `split`)

## Buffers

### Log Buffer

`ll`, `lh`, `lo`, ...

Shows a graph of the commit history. Hitting `<cr>` will open the Commit View for that commit.

The following popups are available from the log buffer, and will use the commit under the cursor, or selected, instead of prompting:
* Branch Popup
* Cherry Pick Popup
* Revert Popup
* Rebase Popup
* Commit Popup
* Reset Popup

### Reflog Buffer

`lr`, `lH`, `lO`

Shows your reflog history. Hitting `<cr>` will open the Commit View for that commit.

The following popups are available from the reflog buffer, and will use the commit under the cursor, or selected, instead of prompting:
* Branch Popup
* Cherry Pick Popup
* Revert Popup
* Rebase Popup
* Commit Popup
* Reset Popup

### Commit View

`<cr>` on a commit.

Shows details for a specific commit.
The following popups are available from the commit buffer, using it's SHA instead of prompting:
* Branch Popup
* Cherry Pick Popup
* Revert Popup
* Rebase Popup
* Commit Popup
* Reset Popup

### Status Buffer
A full list of status buffer commands can be found above under "configuration".

### Fuzzy Finder
A full list of fuzzy-finder commands can be found above under "configuration".
If [nvim-telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) is installed, a custom finder will be used that allows for multi-select (in some places) and some other cool things. Otherwise, `vim.ui.select` will be used as a slightly less featurefull fallback.

## Highlight Groups

See the built-in documentation for a comprehensive list of highlight groups. If your theme doesn't style a particular group, we'll try our best to do a nice job.


## Events

Neogit emits the following events:

| Event                   | Description                              | Event Data                                      |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `NeogitStatusRefreshed` | Status has been reloaded                 | `{}`                                            |
| `NeogitCommitComplete`  | Commit has been created                  | `{}`                                            |
| `NeogitPushComplete`    | Push has completed                       | `{}`                                            |
| `NeogitPullComplete`    | Pull has completed                       | `{}`                                            |
| `NeogitFetchComplete`   | Fetch has completed                      | `{}`                                            |
| `NeogitBranchCreate`    | Branch was created, starting from `base` | `{ branch_name: string, base: string? }`        |
| `NeogitBranchDelete`    | Branch was deleted                       | `{ branch_name: string }`                       |
| `NeogitBranchCheckout`  | Branch was checked out                   | `{ branch_name: string }`                       |
| `NeogitBranchReset`     | Branch was reset to a commit/branch      | `{ branch_name: string, resetting_to: string }` |
| `NeogitBranchRename`    | Branch was renamed                       | `{ branch_name: string, new_name: string }`     |
| `NeogitRebase`        | A rebase finished                        | `{ commit: string, status: "ok"\|"conflict" }`    |
| `NeogitReset`         | A branch was reset to a certain commit   | `{ commit: string, mode: "soft"\|"mixed"\|"hard"\|"keep"\|"index" }` |
| `NeogitTagCreate`     | A tag was placed on a certain commit     | `{ name: string, ref: string }`                   |
| `NeogitTagDelete`     | A tag was removed                        | `{ name: string }`                                |
| `NeogitCherryPick`    | One or more commits were cherry-picked    | `{ commits: string[] }`                          |
| `NeogitMerge`         | A merge finished                          | `{ branch: string, args = string[], status: "ok"\|"conflict" }` |

You can listen to the events using the following code:

```vim
autocmd User NeogitStatusRefreshed echo "Hello World!"
```

Or, if you prefer to configure autocommands via Lua:

```lua
local group = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup('MyCustomNeogitEvents', { clear = true })
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', {
  pattern = 'NeogitPushComplete',
  group = group,
  callback = require('neogit').close,
})
```

## Refreshing Neogit

If you would like to refresh Neogit manually, you can use `neogit#refresh_manually` in Vimscript or `require('neogit').refresh_manually` in lua. They both require a single file parameter.

This allows you to refresh Neogit on your own custom events

```vim
augroup DefaultRefreshEvents
  au!
  au BufWritePost,BufEnter,FocusGained,ShellCmdPost,VimResume * call <SID>neogit#refresh_manually(expand('<afile>'))
augroup END
```

## Testing

Run `make test` after checking out the repo. All dependencies should get automatically downloaded to `/tmp/neogit-test/`
