1. Intro                                                          *neogit_intro*

Neogit is a git client for Neovim built as a clone of the popular emacs git
client 'Magit'.

"Magit is a complete text-based user interface to Git. It fills the glaring
gap between the Git command-line interface and various GUIs, letting you
perform trivial as well as elaborate version control tasks with just a couple
of mnemonic key presses. Magit looks like a prettified version of what you get
after running a few Git commands but in Magit every bit of visible information
is also actionable to an extent that goes far beyond what any Git GUI provides
and it takes care of automatically refreshing this output when it becomes
outdated. In the background Magit just runs Git commands and if you wish you
can see what exactly is being run, making it possible for you to learn the git
command-line by using Magit.

Using Magit for a while will make you a more effective version control user.
Magit supports and streamlines the use of Git features that most users and
developers of other Git clients apparently thought could not be reasonably
mapped to a non-command-line interface. Magit is both faster and more
intuitive than either the command line or any GUI and these holds for both
Git beginners and experts alike."

Though not yet feature complete, our goal is to bring the Magit git experience
to Neovim users.

A Neogit popup is a client interface over a git subcommand or other
git mechanism.

==============================================================================
Cherry-Pick Popup                                     *neogit_cherry_pick_popup*

Arguments:                                       *neogit_cherry_pick_popup_args*
  • --ff
    If the current HEAD is the same as the parent of the cherry-pick’ed
    commit, then a fast forward to this commit will be performed.

Actions:                                      *neogit_cherry_pick_popup_actions*
  Actions for the branch popup are split into two categories: "Apply here",
  and "Apply elsewhere". The former will update the current HEAD, whereas the
  latter will prompt for a target.

  When a Cherry-Pick isn't in progress, the following actions are available:

  • Pick                                               *neogit_cherry_pick_pick*
    This command copies COMMITS from another branch onto the current branch.
    If a commit is under the cursor, or multiple commits are selected, then
    those are used instead of prompting. Otherwise the user is prompted to
    select one or more commits.

  • Apply                                             *neogit_cherry_pick_apply*
    This command applies the changes in COMMITS from another branch onto the
    current branch, without committing. If a commit is under the cursor, or
    multiple commits are selected, then those are used instead of prompting.
    Otherwise the user is prompted to select one or more commits.

  • Harvest                                         *neogit_cherry_pick_harvest*
    (Not yet implemented)

  • Squash                                           *neogit_cherry_pick_squash*
    (Not yet implemented)

  • Donate                                           *neogit_cherry_pick_donate*
    (Not yet implemented)

  • Spinout                                         *neogit_cherry_pick_spinout*
    (Not yet implemented)

  • Spinoff                                         *neogit_cherry_pick_spinoff*
    (Not yet implemented)


  When a Cherry-Pick is in progress, the following actions are available:

  • Continue                                       *neogit_cherry_pick_continue*
    Resume current cherry-pick sequence.

  • Skip                                               *neogit_cherry_pick_skip*
    Skip the current commit during a cherry-pick sequence.

  • Abort                                             *neogit_cherry_pick_abort*
    Abort the current cherry-pick sequence. This discards all changes made.

==============================================================================
Branch Popup                                               *neogit_branch_popup*

Variables:                                       *neogit_branch_popup_variables*
  • branch.<name>.description

  • branch.<name>.merge
    branch.<name>.remote

  • branch.<name>.rebase
    Cycles branch.<name>.rebase value between true, false, and the value of
    `pull.rebase`. When enabled, actions like pulling will attempt to rebase
    by default.

  • branch.<name>.pushRemote
    Cycles pushRemote between the remotes currently configured for the
    repository. `remote.pushDefault` will be offered, if set.

Arguments:                                            *neogit_branch_popup_args*
  • --recurse-submodules
    (EXPERIMENTAL) Causes the current command to recurse into submodules if
    submodule.propagateBranches is enabled.

    When used in branch creation, a new branch <branchname> will be created
    in the superproject and all of the submodules in the superproject’s
    <start-point>. In submodules, the branch will point to the submodule
    commit in the superproject’s <start-point> but the branch’s tracking
    information will be set up based on the submodule’s branches and remotes
    e.g.  git branch --recurse-submodules topic origin/main will create the
    submodule branch "topic" that points to the submodule commit in the
    superproject’s "origin/main", but tracks the submodule’s "origin/main".

Actions:                                           *neogit_branch_popup_actions*
  Actions for the branch popup are split into three categories: "Checkout",
  "Create", and "Do". They behave as described: "Checkout" actions will change
  your HEAD when checking out the selected/created branch. "Create" actions,
  by contrast, will _not_ change HEAD.

  Finally, "Do" actions provide some common housekeeping actions.

  • Checkout branch/revision                        *neogit_branch_checkout_rev*
    Changes HEAD to point to the selected branch/revision. If a local branch
    is selected, that will be checked out. Otherwise HEAD will become
    detatched. Any ref under the cursor or selected will be available to
    checkout.

  • Checkout local branch                         *neogit_branch_checkout_local*
    Changes HEAD to point to the selected branch. Also lists branches on
    remotes that do not have a matching branch locally. If a remote branch is
    selected, then a local branch is created tracking the selected remote
    branch.

  • Checkout recent branch                       *neogit_branch_checkout_recent*
    Changes HEAD to point to the selected branch. Branches are listed by how
    recently they have been checked out. Only local branches are considered.

  • Checkout new branch                             *neogit_branch_checkout_new*
    Creates and switches HEAD to a new branch. Any whitespace in the branch
    name will be automatically changed to '-'.

    For example, entering "new branch name" will result in a branch called
    "new-branch-name" being created.

    After entering a name, you will be prompted to choose a base branch for
    the branch being created. The current branch will be at the top of the
    list, but any branch can be chosen.

  • Checkout new spin-off                               *neogit_branch_spin_off*
    This command creates and checks out a new branch starting at and tracking
    the current branch. That branch in turn is reset to the last commit it
    shares with its upstream. If the current branch has no upstream or no
    unpushed commits, then the new branch is created anyway and the previously
    current branch is not touched.

    This is useful to create a feature branch after work has already began on
    the old branch.

  • Checkout new worktree                      *neogit_branch_checkout_worktree*
    (Not yet implemented)

  • Create new branch                              *neogit_branch_create_branch*
    Functionally the same as |neogit_branch_checkout_new|, but does not update
    HEAD.

  • Create new spin-out                                 *neogit_branch_spin_out*
    Like |neogit_branch_spin_off|, but doesn't change HEAD. However, if the
    index has uncomitted changes, will behave exactly the same as spin_off.

  • Create new worktree                          *neogit_branch_create_worktree*
    (Not yet implemented)

  • Configure                                          *neogit_branch_configure*
    Opens selector to choose a branch, then offering some configuration
    options. See |neogit_branch_config_popup|.

  • Rename                                                *neogit_branch_rename*
    Opens selector to choose a branch to rename. Like with a new branch, any
    whitespace will be replaced with '-'.

  • Reset                                                  *neogit_branch_reset*
    Resets the current branch to the the selected branch via a hard reset.
    Uncommitted changes will be lost in the process.

  • Delete                                                *neogit_branch_delete*
    Opens selector, allowing the user to delete either a local or remote
    branch.

  • Pull Request                                    *neogit_branch_pull_request*
    When a branch has an upstream configured, can be used to open a
    pull-request on the git services' website. By default, supports github,
    gitlab, and bitbucket, but more can be added via config.git_services.


==============================================================================
Branch Config Popup                                 *neogit_branch_config_popup*

Allows configuring some common config settings for the selected branch, as
well as some repository defaults.

Branch:
  • branch.<name>.description                 *neogit_branch_config_description*
    Branch description is automatically added in the format-patch cover letter
    or request-pull summary.

  • branch.<name>.merge                             *neogit_branch_config_merge*
    Defines, together with branch.<name>.remote, the upstream branch for the
    given branch. It tells git fetch/git pull/git rebase which branch to merge
    and can also affect git push (see push.default). When in branch <name>,
    it tells git fetch the default refspec to be marked for merging in
    FETCH_HEAD. The value is handled like the remote part of a refspec, and
    must match a ref which is fetched from the remote given by
    "branch.<name>.remote".

    The merge information is used by git pull (which at first calls git fetch)
    to lookup the default branch for merging.

    Without this option, git pull defaults to merge the first refspec fetched.
    Specify multiple values to get an octopus merge. If you wish to setup git
    pull so that it merges into <name> from another branch in the local
    repository, you can point branch.<name>.merge to the desired branch, and
    use the relative path setting . (a period) for branch.<name>.remote.

  • branch.<name>.remote                           *neogit_branch_config_remote*
    When on branch <name>, it tells git fetch and git push which remote to
    fetch from/push to. The remote to push to may be overridden with
    remote.pushDefault (for all branches). The remote to push to, for the
    current branch, may be further overridden by branch.<name>.pushRemote. If
    no remote is configured, or if you are not on any branch and there is more
    than one remote defined in the repository, it defaults to origin for
    fetching and remote.pushDefault for pushing. Additionally, . (a period) is
    the current local repository (a dot-repository), see branch.<name>.merge's
    final note below.

  • branch.<name>.rebase                           *neogit_branch_config_rebase*
    When true, rebase the branch <name> on top of the fetched branch, instead
    of merging the default branch from the default remote when "git pull" is
    run. See "pull.rebase" for doing this in a non branch-specific manner.

    NOTE: this is a possibly dangerous operation; do not use it unless you
    understand the implications (see git-rebase(1) for details).

  • branch.<name>.pushRemote                   *neogit_branch_config_pushRemote*
    When on branch <name>, it overrides branch.<name>.remote for pushing. It
    also overrides remote.pushDefault for pushing from branch <name>. When you
    pull from one place (e.g. your upstream) and push to another place (e.g.
    your own publishing repository), you would want to set remote.pushDefault
    to specify the remote to push to for all branches, and use this option to
    override it for a specific branch.

Repository defaults:
  • pull.rebase                               *neogit_branch_config_pull_rebase*
    When true, rebase branches on top of the fetched branch, instead of
    merging the default branch from the default remote when "git pull" is run.
    Use "branch.<name>.rebase" for setting this on a per-branch basis.

    NOTE: this is a possibly dangerous operation; do not use it unless you
    understand the implications (see git-rebase[1] for details).

  • remote.pushDefault                 *neogit_branch_config_remote_pushDefault*
    The remote to push to by default. Overrides branch.<name>.remote for all
    branches, and is overridden by branch.<name>.pushRemote for specific
    branches.

  • neogit.baseBranch                          *neogit_branch_config_baseBranch*
    If set, will be used by "rebase onto base" action. Otherwise defaults to
    either "main" or "master", depending on which is found.

  • neogit.askSetPushDefault            *neogit_branch_config_askSetPushDefault*
    This option controls whether the user is asked whether they want to set
    remote.pushDefault after adding a remote.

    When set to 'ask', the user is always asked.

    When 'ask-if-unset', the user is only asked if the variable isn’t set.
    (This is also the default behaviour when unset.)

    When 'never', the user isn’t asked and the variable isn’t set.

Branch creation:
  • branch.autoSetupMerge                  *neogit_branch_config_autoSetupMerge*
    Tells git branch, git switch and git checkout to set up new branches so
    that git-pull(1) will appropriately merge from the starting point branch.

    false   — No automatic setup is done.

    true    — Automatic setup is done when the starting point is a
              remote-tracking branch.

    always  — Automatic setup is done when the starting point is either a
              local branch or remote-tracking branch.

    inherit — If the starting point has a tracking configuration, it is copied
              to the new branch.

    simple  — Automatic setup is done only when the starting point is a
              remote-tracking branch and the new branch has the same name as
              the remote branch.

    This option defaults to true.

  • branch.autoSetupRebase                *neogit_branch_config_autoSetupRebase*
    When a new branch is created with git branch, git switch or git checkout
    that tracks another branch, this variable tells Git to set up pull to
    rebase instead of merge (see "branch.<name>.rebase").

    never  - Rebase is never automatically set to true.

    local  - Rebase is set to true for tracked branches of other local
             branches.

    remote - Rebase is set to true for tracked branches of remote-tracking
             branches.

    always - Rebase will be set to true for all tracking branches.

    See "branch.autoSetupMerge" for details on how to set up a branch to track
    another branch.

    This option defaults to never.

==============================================================================
Commit Popup                                               *neogit_commit_popup*

Arguments:                                            *neogit_commit_popup_args*
  • --all
    Tell the command to automatically stage files that have been modified and
    deleted, but new files you have not told Git about are not affected.

  • --allow-empty
    Usually recording a commit that has the exact same tree as its sole parent
    commit is a mistake, and the command prevents you from making such a
    commit. This option bypasses the safety, and is primarily for use by
    foreign SCM interface scripts.

  • --verbose
    Show unified diff between the HEAD commit and what would be committed at
    the bottom of the commit message template to help the user describe the
    commit by reminding what changes the commit has. Note that this diff
    output doesn’t have its lines prefixed with #. This diff will not be a
    part of the commit message. See the `commit.verbose` configuration variable
    in git-config(1).

  • --no-verify
    Skip any pre-commit or commit-msg hooks. See also githooks(5).

  • --signoff
    Add a Signed-off-by trailer by the committer at the end of the commit log
    message. The meaning of a signoff depends on the project to which you’re
    committing. For example, it may certify that the committer has the rights
    to submit the work under the project’s license or agrees to some
    contributor representation, such as a Developer Certificate of Origin.

    See http://developercertificate.org for the one used by the Linux kernel
    and Git projects.

    Consult the documentation or leadership of the project to which you’re
    contributing to understand how the signoffs are used in that project.

  • --no-gpg-sign
    This is useful to countermand both commit.gpgSign configuration variable,
    and --gpg-sign

  • --reset-author
    When used while ammending or when committing after a conflicting
    cherry-pick, declare that the authorship of the resulting commit now
    belongs to the committer. This also renews the author timestamp.

  • --author=
    Override the commit author. Specify an explicit author using the standard
    A U Thor <author@example.com> format. Otherwise <author> is assumed to be
    a pattern and is used to search for an existing commit by that author
    (i.e. rev-list --all -i --author=<author>); the commit author is then
    copied from the first such commit found.

  • --gpg-sign=
    GPG-sign commits. The argument should be the keyid is optional and
    defaults to the committer identity,

  • --reuse-message=
    Take an existing commit object, and reuse the log message and the
    authorship information (including the timestamp) when creating the commit.

Actions:                                           *neogit_commit_popup_actions*
  Actions in the commit popup are in three groups: "Create", "Edit HEAD", and
  "Edit". The first should be somewhat self explanatory - you can create a new
  commit from your staged changes. "Edit HEAD" actions will modify the current
  commit HEAD is pointing at, and "Edit" will modify commits that your HEAD
  isn't pointing to.

  • Create Commit                                         *neogit_commit_create*
    Creates a new commit on the current branch from the currently staged
    changes.

  • Extend                                                *neogit_commit_extend*
    Amends the last commit without editing the commit message.

  • Reword                                                *neogit_commit_reword*
    Edit the last commit message without modifying the committed changes. Any
    staged changes are ignored.

  • Amend                                                  *neogit_commit_amend*
    Amend the last commit.

  • Fixup                                                  *neogit_commit_fixup*
    Creates a fixup commit. If a commit is selected it will be used, otherwise
    the user is prompted to pick a commit.

  • Squash                                                *neogit_commit_squash*
    Creates a squash commit. If a commit is selected it will be used,
    otherwise the user is prompted to pick a commit.

  • Augment                                              *neogit_commit_augment*
    Creates a squash commit, editing the squash message. If a commit is
    selected it will be used, otherwise the user is prompted to pick a commit.

  • Instant Fixup                                  *neogit_commit_instant_fixup*
    Similar to |neogit_commit_fixup|, but instantly rebases after.

  • Instant Squash                                *neogit_commit_instant_squash*

Fetch Popup                                                 *neogit_fetch_popup*

Arguments:                                             *neogit_fetch_popup_args*
  • --prune
    Before fetching, remove any remote-tracking references that no longer
    exist on the remote. Tags are not subject to pruning if they are fetched
    only because of the default tag auto-following or due to a --tags option.

    However, if tags are fetched due to an explicit refspec (either on the
    command line or in the remote configuration, for example if the remote was
    cloned with the --mirror option), then they are also subject to pruning.

  • --tags
    Fetch all tags from the remote (i.e., fetch remote tags refs/tags/* into
    local tags with the same name), in addition to whatever else would
    otherwise be fetched. Using this option alone does not subject tags to
    pruning, even if --prune is used (though tags may be pruned anyway if
    they are also the destination of an explicit refspec; see --prune).

Actions:                                            *neogit_fetch_popup_actions*
  • Fetch from pushRemote                              *neogit_fetch_pushremote*
    Fetches from the current pushRemote.

    When the pushRemote is not configured, the user will be prompted to choose
    from the existing remotes to set it.

  • Fetch from upstream                                  *neogit_fetch_upstream*
    Fetches from the upstream of the current branch.

    If the upstream is configured for the current branch and names an existing
    remote, then use that. Otherwise try to use another remote: If only a
    single remote is configured, then use that. Otherwise if a remote named
    "origin" exists, then use that.

  • Fetch from elsewhere                                *neogit_fetch_elsewhere*
    Provides a select interface for the user to choose which remote to fetch
    from.

  • Fetch from All Remotes                                    *neogit_fetch_all*
    Fetches from all configured remotes.

  • Fetch Another Branch                                   *neogit_fetch_branch*
    Fetches only a specific branch from a remote, both of which are selected
    by the user.

  • Fetch Explicit Refspec                                *neogit_fetch_refspec*
    Fetches from a remote using an explicit refspec.

  • Fetch Submodules                                   *neogit_fetch_submodules*
    Fetches all submodules.

  • Set Variables                                   *neogit_fetch_set_variables*
    Opens Branch Config popup for the current branch.
    See |neogit_branch_config_popup|.

==============================================================================
Remote Config Popup                                 *neogit_remote_config_popup*

Allows configuring some common config variables for the selected remote.

Remote:
  • remote.<name>.url                                 *neogit_remote_config_url*
    The URL of a remote repository.

  • remote.<name>.fetch                             *neogit_remote_config_fetch*
    The default set of "refspec" for git fetch.

  • remote.<name>.pushurl                         *neogit_remote_config_pushurl*
    The push URL of a remote repository

  • remote.<name>.push                               *neogit_remote_config_push*
    The default set of "refspec" for git-push

  • remote.<name>.tagOpt                           *neogit_remote_config_tagOpt*
    Setting this value to --no-tags disables automatic tag following when
    fetching from remote <name>. Setting it to --tags will fetch every tag
    from remote <name>, even if they are not reachable from remote branch
    heads.

    Passing these flags directly to git fetch can override this setting.
    See |neogit_fetch_popup_args|.

Pull Popup                                                   *neogit_pull_popup*

(TODO)

==============================================================================
Push Popup                                                   *neogit_push_popup*

Arguments:                                              *neogit_push_popup_args*
  • --force-with-lease
    Usually, "git push" refuses to update a remote ref that is not an ancestor
    of the local ref used to overwrite it.

    This option overrides this restriction if the current value of the remote
    ref is the expected value. "git push" fails otherwise.

    Imagine that you have to rebase what you have already published. You will
    have to bypass the "must fast-forward" rule in order to replace the
    history you originally published with the rebased history. If somebody
    else built on top of your original history while you are rebasing, the tip
    of the branch at the remote may advance with their commit, and blindly
    pushing with --force will lose their work.

    This option allows you to say that you expect the history you are updating
    is what you rebased and want to replace. If the remote ref still points at
    the commit you specified, you can be sure that no other people did
    anything to the ref. It is like taking a "lease" on the ref without
    explicitly locking it, and the remote ref is updated only if the "lease"
    is still valid.

  • --force
    Usually, the command refuses to update a remote ref that is not an
    ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it. Also, when
    --force-with-lease option is used, the command refuses to update a remote
    ref whose current value does not match what is expected.

    This flag disables these checks, and can cause the remote repository to
    lose commits; use it with care.

    Note that --force applies to all the refs that are pushed, hence using it
    with push.default set to matching or with multiple push destinations
    configured with remote.*.push may overwrite refs other than the current
    branch (including local refs that are strictly behind their remote
    counterpart).

  • --set-upstream
    For every branch that is up to date or successfully pushed, add upstream
    (tracking) reference.

  • --no-verify
    Skips runing any pre-push git hooks. By default, all hooks are run.

  • --dry-run
    Do everything except actually send the updates.

Actions:                                             *neogit_push_popup_actions*
  • Push <current> to pushRemote                        *neogit_push_pushRemote*
    Pushes the current branch to `branch.<name>.pushRemote`. If that is unset,
    to `remote.pushDefault`. And if _that_ is unset, the user will be prompted
    to select a remote, which will be used to set `branch.<name>.pushRemote`,
    and pushed to.

  • Push <current> to @{upstream}                         *neogit_push_upstream*
    Pushes the current branch to it's upstream branch. If not set, then the
    user will be prompted to select a remote, which will be set as the
    current branch's upstream and pushed to.

  • Push <current> elsewhere                             *neogit_push_elsewhere*
    Pushes the current branch to a branch selected by the user.

  • Push another branch                             *neogit_push_another_branch*
    Push a branch or commit somewhere. Both source and target are selected by
    the user.

  • Push explicit refspecs                       *neogit_push_explicit_refspecs*

    (Not yet implemented)

  • Push all tags                                         *neogit_push_all_tags*
    Pushes all tags to selected remote. If only one remote exists, that will
    be used; otherwise the user will be prompted to select a remote.

  • Set Variables                                    *neogit_push_set_variables*
    Opens Branch Config popup for the current branch.

Revert Popup                                               *neogit_revert_popup*

Arguments:                                            *neogit_revert_popup_args*
  • --mainline
    Usually you cannot revert a merge because you do not know which side of the
    merge should be considered the mainline. This option specifies the parent
    number (starting from 1) of the mainline and allows revert to reverse the
    change relative to the specified parent.

    Reverting a merge commit declares that you will never want the tree changes
    brought in by the merge. As a result, later merges will only bring in tree
    changes introduced by commits that are not ancestors of the previously
    reverted merge. This may or may not be what you want.

  • --edit
    With this option, git revert will let you edit the commit message prior to
    committing the revert. This is the default.

    Cannot be used with --no-edit

  • --no-edit
    With this option, git revert will auto-generate the commit message without
    bringing up the commit message editor.

    Cannot be used with --edit

Actions:                                           *neogit_revert_popup_actions*
  • Revert Commit(s)                                     *neogit_revert_commits*
    Reverts one or more commits. If any commits are under the cursor, or
    selected, they will be used. Otherwise a selector interface will come up.

    Will create a commit of the reverted changes.

  • Revert Changes                                       *neogit_revert_changes*
    Reverts one or more commits WITHOUT committing the worktree. If any commits
    are under the cursor, or selected, they will be used. Otherwise a selector
    interface will come up.

==============================================================================
Reset Popup                                                 *neogit_reset_popup*

All actions will default to the commit under cursor if there is one, or prompt
the user to select one if there is not.

Actions:                                            *neogit_reset_popup_actions*
  • Mixed                                                   *neogit_reset_mixed*
    Resets the index but not the working tree (i.e., the changed files are
    preserved but not marked for commit).

  • Soft                                                     *neogit_reset_soft*
    Does not touch the index file or the working tree at all (but resets the
    head to <commit>, just like all modes do). This leaves all your changed
    files "Changes to be committed", as git status would put it.

  • Hard                                                     *neogit_reset_hard*
    Resets the index and working tree. Any changes to tracked files in the
    working tree since <commit> are discarded. Any untracked files or
    directories in the way of writing any tracked files are simply deleted.

  • Keep                                                     *neogit_reset_keep*
    Resets index entries and updates files in the working tree that are
    different between <commit> and HEAD. If a file that is different between
    <commit> and HEAD has local changes, reset is aborted.

  • Index                                                   *neogit_reset_index*
    Reset the index to <commit>, keeping the HEAD and working tree as-is.

    For example, if the commit refers to the HEAD, then this would unstage all
    changes.

  • Worktree                                             *neogit_reset_worktree*

Arguments:                                               *neogit_tag_popup_args*
  • --force
    Replace an existing tag with the given name (instead of failing)

  • --annotate
    Make an unsigned, annotated tag object

  • --sign
    Make a GPG-signed tag, using the default e-mail address’s key. The default
    behavior of tag GPG-signing is controlled by `tag.gpgSign` configuration
    variable if it exists, or disabled otherwise.

  • --local-user
    Make a GPG-signed tag, using the given key.

  • Delete                                                   *neogit_tag_delete*
    Deletes one or more tags.

  • Prune                                                     *neogit_tag_prune*
