-- This is a table to look up pending neogit operations.
-- An operation is loosely defined as a user-triggered, top-level execution
-- like "commit", "stash" or "pull".
-- This module exists mostly as a stop-gap, since plenary's busted port cannot
-- currently test asynchronous operations.
-- Since operations are usually triggered by keyboard shortcuts but run async,
-- dependent code has a hard time synchronizing with the execution.
-- To solve this issue, neogit operations will register themselves here in a
-- table. Dependent code can then look up the invoked operation and track it's
-- execution status.
